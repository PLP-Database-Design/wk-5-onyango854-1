**Course:** Software Testing & Quality Assurance  
**Module:** Test Management (Week 5)  
**Team:** Alex Johnson, Sarah Chen, Mike Rodriguez  
**Submission Date:** October 28, 2025

## 1. Project Overview
Word Puzzle Game Plus is a browser-based word puzzle game designed to enhance user engagement through scoring, hints, bonus rounds, and a leaderboard. This report summarizes test management practices, risk analysis, test execution, and defect logging.

## 2. Test Objectives
- Verify game features function correctly.
- Detect and document defects.
- Assess risk coverage through structured testing.
- Measure quality through metrics like pass rate and defect density.

## 3. Test Scope
- **In Scope:** Reset game, leaderboard, bonus round, hint system, input validation.
- **Out of Scope:** Multiplayer mode, user authentication (not implemented in current version).

## 4. Team Roles
| Role | Name | Responsibilities |
|------|------|-----------------|
| Test Manager | Erick Omondi | Test planning, schedule, metrics tracking |
| Risk Analyst | Henok Girma | Risk analysis, test design, risk coverage |
| Test Executor | Lydiah Awour | Execute tests, defect logging, evidence collection |

## 5. Risk Analysis
| Risk ID | Description | Severity | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|---------|------------|
| R1 | Data corruption in leaderboard | High | Validate leaderboard updates, backup localStorage |
| R2 | Bonus round logic errors | High | Execute bonus rounds thoroughly, track score doubling |
| R3 | Accidental reset | Medium | Confirm reset button functionality with warnings |
| R4 | Input validation errors | Medium | Test invalid/empty inputs thoroughly |
| R5 | UI message persistence | Low | Adjust timing for bonus/feedback messages |
| R6 | Storage limits | Low | Monitor localStorage limits, implement overflow handling |

## 6. Test Cases Summary
- Total Test Cases: 8  
- Risk-Based: 5  
- Negative: 2  
- Usability: 1  
- Pass Rate: 100%  

## 7. Metrics
| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Test Case Pass Rate | 100% | 8/8 |
| Defect Density | 0.375 | 3 defects / 8 test cases |
| Risk Coverage | 100% | 6/6 risks addressed |

## 8. Critical Findings
1. Hint cost bug — deduction fails when score < 2  
2. Leaderboard duplication — multiple identical entries possible  
3. Bonus round message persistence — may display too long

## 9. Reflection & Lessons Learned
- Effective team collaboration improves test coverage.  
- Risk-based testing identifies high-impact defects efficiently.  
- Metrics provide a clear measure of project quality.  
- Proper GitHub issue tracking ensures transparent defect management.

## 10. Conclusion
The Word Puzzle Game Plus application was thoroughly tested, all planned test cases executed, risks addressed, and defects documented. This project demonstrates solid test management practices applied in a real-world scenario.
